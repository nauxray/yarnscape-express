  "content": "I bought this yarn because I was curious about the reflective effects, and it really works! It's amazing =) I am working on a hat and scarf set and will try it out while walking my dog at night. Apart from the amazing effect, really unique on the market, the wool/polyamide combination is soft and warm, and easy to work too. All colours are very nice, I personally adore the red I've bought - not Rudolph-nose bright nor too dark, very stylish.",
